# 🧠 Evolutionary Tic-Tac-Toe with Self-Learning AI

An evolving **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where an AI learns endlessly from every match and can even **train itself by playing alone**.  
Enjoy a **modern flat design**, **smooth animations**, **customizable themes**, **data export/import**, and **live AI self-play visualization** — all fully responsive and infinitely improving.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The AI analyzes every move made by the player, tracking **winning patterns**, **strategies**, and **mistakes**.  
Over time, it builds a dataset of experiences to **improve decision-making** and **optimize its future games**.

In **Auto-Study Mode**, the AI **plays against itself** — you can **watch live** as it trains, adapts, and refines its skills without human input.
